# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

This is a fun **Turtle Racing Game** built with Python's `turtle` module. Players can choose the number of turtles (racers), and the race begins with each turtle moving forward randomly. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins! 🎉

---

## 📌 How to Play
1. **Run the script** to start the game.
2. **Enter the number of racers** (between 2 and 10).
3. Watch the turtles **race to the finish line**.
4. The winning turtle's **color is displayed at the end**.

---

## 🎮 Game Rules
- The race takes place on a **700x600 pixel screen**.
- Turtles **move randomly** between 1 and 20 pixels per turn.
- The **first turtle to reach the top** of the screen wins.
- The game will **display the winner's color** after the race.

---

## 🎨 Turtle Colors
Each turtle is assigned a unique color from this list:
```
['red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange', 'yellow', 'black', 'purple', 'pink', 'brown', 'cyan']
```
The colors are **randomly shuffled** for fairness.
